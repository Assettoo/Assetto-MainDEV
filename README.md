# ASSETTO


## What is really is ASSETTO ?

<Strong>ASSETTO</Strong> is a Decentralised DAPP Build on <Strong>NERVOUS NETWORK BLOCKCHAIN</Strong> to <Strong>STORE AND RETRIEVE</Strong> 
Important and Confedential ASSET/DOC/FILE Storage Management Platform which is Super Easy to Use with an Eye Catchy UI and Awesome UX.


## We are using different Tech Stack to achieve it.

 1)We have Create a <Strong>FRONTEND</Strong> with the help of <Strong>CREATE-REACT-APP(CRA)</Strong> using Hooks and web3context to optimise the         performance and using <Strong>pw-SDK</Strong> from nervous network platform.

 2)We have used Solidity to create <Strong>SMART CONTRACT</Strong> (FOR OUR LOGIC) to store different important docs on the <Strong>NERVOUS NETWORK       BLOCKCHAIN.</Strong>

 3)We have used Truffle framework with Ganache to test our DApp on local Enviornment.

 4)We have used <Strong>GODWOKEN L2 TESTNET</Strong> to Deploy our DAPP and implemented Succesfull Transactions for our DApp.

 5)We have used <Strong>IPFS API(BY INFURA)</Strong> to Upload,Retrieve etc our Docs on the DECENTRALISED PLATFORM as AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) 
   encryption is used to encrypt data before uploading to IPFS(Inter Planetary File System).
 
 6)We have used used <Strong>METAMASK & CONNECT WALLET</Strong> for CKB transaction through our integration with <Strong>pw-core(pw-SDK).</Strong>
 
 7)We have used <Strong>CKB TestNetwork and Nervos Aggron Faucet</Strong> to burn some CKB.

 8)We have used NETIFY fro HOSTING purposes.
 
 
 
 ## How to Use this DAPP ?
 
 1)Install npx/npm/yarn and CRA.
 
 2)Install the necessary DEPENDENCIES used in the DApp by npm i.
 
 3)Then the dapp on local host by npm start.
 
 4)Connect your Web3 Wallet with application (METAMASK,WALLETCONNECT OPTIONS)-->Connect to your NERVOUS NETWORK WALLET. 
 
 5)Now you can UPLOAD,RETRIEVE,CREATE,STORE etc any imp Document/File/Image etc on the NERVOUS NETWORK BLOCKCHAIN with a HASH KEY.
 
 6)Now after succesful transaction with a negligible fee you can use this HASH KEY in the form of a RECEIPT certificate for future use.
 
 7)Later on we can <Strong>CHECK FOR THE AUTHENTICITY OF ANY DOC/FILE/ASSET</Strong> etc ON CHAIN WITH JUST THE HASH KEY.
