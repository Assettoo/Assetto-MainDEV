# ASSETTO is a Decentralised IMP DOC storage DAPP Build on Nervous Network Blockchain.



 ## We are using different Tech Stack to achieve it.

 1)We have Create a FRONTEND with the help of CREATE-REACT-APP(CRA) using JS library - REACT and using pw-SDK from nervous network.

 2)We have used Solidity to create SMART CONTRACT (OUR LOGIC) to store different important docs on the NERVOUS NETWORK BLOCKCHAIN.

 3)We have used Truffle framework with Ganache to test our DApp on local Enviornment.

 4)We have used GODWOKEN L2 TESTNET to Deploy our DAPP and implemented Succesfull Transactions for our DApp.

 5)We have used IPFS(BY INFURA) to Upload,Retrieve etc our Docs on the DECENTRALISED PLATFORM.
 
 6)We have used used METAMASK & CONNECT WALLET for CKB transaction through our integration with pw-core(pw-SDK).
 
 7)We have used CKB testnetwork and Nervos Aggron Faucet to burn some CKB.

 8)We have used NETIFY fro HOSTING purposes.
